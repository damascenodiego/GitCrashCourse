# Git Crash Course Example - donationGame

This program runs a tournament among different strategies which play the donation game (see below). 

Each competitor implements an interface Competitor which can be found in the package **br.usp.icmc.ssc01032015**.

You can contribute with the donation game creating your own competitor extending the AbstractCompetitor class
and a custom Tournament class.

The tournament happens on a sequence of turns. 
On each run each pair of competitors meet and must decide what to do with a money it receives. 
Each competitor must decide what to do with R$ 10.00 and how much it will give to the other competitor. 

The amount donated will be informed using the **declareDonationTo** method. A value between 0.0 and 10.0 must be given.
Each competitor receive an information of how much it will receive from the other competitor (use for it **informDonationFrom** method ). 

**_Competitors can't ask questions!!!_**

Each competitor receives an amount of money of 10.0 minus the amount given to the other plus 2x what it received from the other. (use the method **addCash**).

You can add your competitors in the package **br.usp.icmc.ssc01032015.competitors.id_YOUR-ID** and your Tournament classes in the package **br.usp.icmc.ssc01032015.tournament.id_YOUR-ID**.
